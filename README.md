**Innerk Hub** is a web-based application designed to streamline academic research collaboration in universities. It helps researchers find collaborators, manage projects, share documents, track funding, and receive guidance from reviewers‚Äîall in one unified platform.

Academic research often suffers from fragmented collaboration, difficulty in finding domain experts, and inefficient tracking of project progress and funding. Innerk Hub addresses these problems by providing a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform tailored for academic environments.
 Objectives
* Enable researchers to **post and manage research projects**.
* Provide tools for **collaboration** including messaging, document sharing, and progress tracking.
* Allow **reviewers** to supervise and give feedback on relevant research topics.
* Help researchers **track funding** and grants with clear dashboards.
* Support **admins** in overseeing platform usage and managing user roles.
